# ScryFall API Data Analysis: 1
This is my first jupyter notebook for scraping scryfall API data--and is referenced from my website article titled 'Scraping Scryfall Magic the Gathering Data: 1 at http://analyze6.com/analyze6/articles/scryfall1.html

It is a jupyter notebook, so should not need much context/explanation here. Just use it as a start to learn how to pull down scryfall data using requests.
